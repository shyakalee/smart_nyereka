This is a multi authentication sample for users,
Usable for managing access to some core functionalities of the system,
Once the user is authenticated, He/she can access some of the actions/functionalities
Functionalitities are assigned accordig to user Group,

To make it clean:
A seller can only access products, orders, Client contacts, only perform view access rights
Admin can access products, orders, clients, staff contacts and perform view, edit, add and delete function

And the system can have more users + with #roles and # actions

Please feel free to get this work integrated for you :)
